Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use

if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.

		cout << "I will add all the numbers from 1 to your max number \n";
		cout << "What is your max number ?? ";
		cin >> maxNum;
		if (maxNum <= 0) cout << "Please enter a number greater than zero!! \n";
	} while (maxNum <= 0);

	for (int i = 0; i <= maxNum; i++) {
		sum += i;
