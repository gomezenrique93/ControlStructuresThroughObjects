/*

 *
 * When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to
determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d = 1/(2gt(squared2))
The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t
is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in
seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the
object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the
function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and
displays the return value.
